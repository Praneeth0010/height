## ðŸ§  Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

In this project, I tried to predict a personâ€™s weight using their height, age, and exercise level with the help of a simple machine learning model called Linear Regression. I started by understanding the data through basic analysis and graphs. Since the original data didnâ€™t have age and exercise level, I added them to make the model more realistic. After training the model, i checked how well it worked using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the results were quite good. This project helped me learn how machine learning can be used in health-related problems and how important it is to prepare the data properly before building a model.
